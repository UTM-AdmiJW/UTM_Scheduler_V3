# UTM Scheduler V3


## What is it?

UTM Scheduler V3, a sequel to the previous [UTM Timetable Generator V2](https://github.com/AdmiJW/UTM-Timetable-Generator-V2). The reason for creating the project:

1. Rewrite the entire project with a better architecture and code quality, especially with the use of Typescript.
2. New functionality to integrate with the backend API provided by [Dr Mohd Razak Bin Samingan](https://www.utm.my/directory/staff/mrazak)
3. More intuitive, standardized and friendly UI/UX with the use of Material UI + Tailwind CSS pair.
